FUTURE NOTE TO SELF:

If I ever want to try and use lazy, I'm just going to use a distribution like
NvChad or something before I try and configure my own neovim config again. I've
found that I just dont have time right now to try and clean everything up as I
go. That's something that I'll have to do from the ground up


# TODO
- [ ] need to change some of the mappings here to match nvchad so that I can
  easily switch between the 2 configurations
- [ ] Need to add the nightfox colorscheme and something with a grayish pastel
  background? (rip pastelbeans)
