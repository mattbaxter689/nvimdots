FUTURE NOTE TO SELF:

If I ever want to try and use lazy, I'm just going to use a distribution like
NvChad or something before I try and configure my own neovim config again. I've
found that I just dont have time right now to try and clean everything up as I
go. That's something that I'll have to do from the ground up
